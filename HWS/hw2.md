# Equisatisfiability of CNF with blocked clause
##### Matouš Mařík
    Let φ be a CNF and C ∈ φ a clause in φ and l ∈ C a literal in C. We say that C is blocked by literal l if for every other clause D ∈ φ which contains ¬l we have that Res(C, D) is a tautology (i.e. there is another literal l′ ∈ C such that ¬l′ ∈ D). Show that φ is equisatisfiable with φ \ {C}, i.e. φ is satisfiable if and only if φ \ {C} is satisfiable.
